<h1>Parkinator Help</h1>
    <h2>Remembering where you parked</h2>
    <p>Parkinator lets you take a picture to remember where you parked. 
    When you do, it also automatically gets the current location from 
    your phone's GPS and places a pin on a map beneath the picture. To 
    do this:
    <ol>
        <li>Tap the information button (the i) on the bottom right of 
            the homescreen</li>
        <li>Tap the camera icon on the next screen</li>
        <li>Take a picture</li>
        <li>Tap the Done button</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Tweeting that your spot is open</h2>
    <p>Tap the action button (2nd button from the left).  Tweeting your
    spot will only work if you have entered a valid Twitter username and
    password into the iOS Twitter settings.</p>
    <h2>Viewing available spots</h2>
    <p>Tap the seach button (2nd button from the right).  Free spaces
    near your location will appear as pins on the map.</p>
